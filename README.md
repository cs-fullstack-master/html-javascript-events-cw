### Exercise 1: Crazy Typewriter
1) Create a simple html form with a textarea form field, and a `clear text` button
2) When the User clicks the `clear text` button, any text already in the textarea should be cleared/erased
3) As the User types, make it so they always enter a set sentence no matter what letters they actually type (each to the User presses a key, your JavaScript should add the next character from your hardcoded sentence to the textarea just as if they typed it).

#### CHALLENGE:
* Start with a list containing multiple canned sentences and randomly pick a sentence when the User resets the form
